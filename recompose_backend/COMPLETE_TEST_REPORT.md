1. ✅ **Backend API** - All endpoints responding
2. ✅ **OpenAI Integration** - Real AI content generation
3. ✅ **Authentication** - JWT working perfectly  
4. ✅ **Database** - CRUD operations functional
5. ✅ **Stripe** - Billing API connected
6. ✅ **Campaigns** - Create and list working
7. ✅ **Error Handling** - Proper error responses
8. ✅ **Logging** - Request/response logging active
9. ✅ **CORS** - Cross-origin requests configured
10. ✅ **Rate Limiting** - Middleware active

## ⚠️ Minor Notes (Non-Critical)

1. **Email Generation**: Requires Pro plan (working as designed)
2. **JWT Secret**: Should be 32+ chars for production (currently 15)
3. **PostgreSQL**: Available but using SQLite for testing (faster setup)
4. **Redis/Celery**: Not running (optional for async tasks)
5. **Anthropic API**: Not configured (OpenAI working, so optional)
